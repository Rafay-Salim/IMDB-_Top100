# 🎬 What Makes a Good Movie? — Analyzing IMDb's Top 1000 Films

This project investigates the characteristics that define a "good" movie by analyzing IMDb's Top 1000 movies dataset. Using a combination of data analysis, visualization, and machine learning, we explore patterns in ratings, genres, directors, actors, budgets, and more to uncover what drives cinematic success.
